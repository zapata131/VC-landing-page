# TACO

TACO (TACO's A Client-side Orchestrator) is the simplest CMS possible. It runs entirely on the client and lets you orchestrate static content without a backend.

## Configuration

1. Clone this repository.
2. Modify the static files to match your content. Update text, images, and configuration variables as needed.

## Deployment

Because TACO is fully client-side, deployment is straightforward:

1. Host the static files on any web server or static site provider (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel).
2. Point your domain to the hosted files.
3. Open the site in your browser to verify everything loads correctly.
